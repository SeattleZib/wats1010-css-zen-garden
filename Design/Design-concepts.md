1. Overall concept and theme.
-Using "Springtime" by Boer Attila as my base theme.
-Will use change theme to "English Cottage Garden" images and icons.
-Change font to a garden theme
-Add hidden audio file of birds

2. How I hope to impact user
-Audio file will welcome user to a serene webpage
-Using the "f-frame" the content is laid out in a way that people normally look at a page
-The use of soothing colors of green will evoke an earthy, natural emotion from the user
-Navigation structure appears natural and blends into the background
-Content appears logically structured
